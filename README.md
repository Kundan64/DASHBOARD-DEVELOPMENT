## Summary

This Power BI Dashboard provides an interactive view of Amazon's global sales data, allowing users to explore and analyze different aspects of the business by interacting with various sections. The numbers and visualizations displayed are dynamic and will update based on the user's selections.

## Key Insights:

#### Total Sales / Quantity / Profit (Top Cards)
Between 2012 and 2015, total sales reached 12.64M, with 178K units sold and 1.47M in profit. This reflects strong market penetration and profitability, especially considering the growing trend year over year.

#### Sales by Year (Line Chart)
Sales nearly doubled from 2.3M in 2012 to 4.3M in 2015, indicating consistent and accelerating growth — a sign of increasing customer base or effective marketing and product expansion.

#### Sales by Region (Map)
The US, Europe, and Asia are the most active sales regions, highlighting strong performance in USCA and Europe, and potential for growth in Asia-Pacific where there are fewer but notable sales locations.

#### Sales by Segment (Pie Chart)
The Consumer segment dominates with 51.5% of total sales, suggesting that B2C is the core revenue driver. However, Corporate (30.3%) and Home Office (18.3%) also represent substantial opportunities.

#### Sales by Market (Donut Chart)
The USCA market accounts for nearly 32% of global sales, making it the top contributor. Europe (26%) and LATAM (18.7%) also show promising figures, while Asia Pacific lags behind (6.2%) — signaling an untapped region.

#### Sales by Customer Name (Bar Chart)
Top 10 customers contributed notably to overall revenue, with Sean Miller leading at 23K. This suggests a possible Pareto trend — where a small group of customers account for a large share of sales.

#### Sales by Category (Pie Chart)
Office Supplies is the top-performing category (37.5%), followed by Furniture (32.5%) and Technology (30%). All three categories contribute fairly evenly, but the margin suggests Office Supplies may be the most scalable.

## Recommendations:
**Market Expansion:** Amazon should invest more in advertising and building better delivery systems in Asia Pacific and the US/Canada. These are their strongest markets with lots of potential customers. Focus on Consumer Products: Given the significant contribution of the Consumer segment, Amazon should focus on enhancing its consumer offerings, improving customer experience, and exploring new product lines or services tailored to consumer needs.

**Review Product Profits:** Amazon should carefully look at why some products make a lot of profit while others don't. They may need to adjust prices, improve delivery, or change which products they sell to make more money.

**Sell in New Countries:** While continuing to sell in their current big markets, Amazon should also look for new countries with lots of potential customers. They may need to adapt their products and marketing for these new markets.

**Use Data to Make Decisions:** Amazon should use the interactive dashboard to constantly check sales numbers, customer preferences, and market trends. This will help them make good decisions and quickly adapt their strategies as things change.

By following these recommendations, Amazon can strengthen its position as a leader, make more money from its products, and find new opportunities for growth while maintaining a customer-centric approach.
